StatsPlugin
===========
By CastleCorp.
Contact information at the bottom.

This is a very lightweight and straightforward plugin. Simply, it logs player deaths, kills, and the player's bank balance.

Commands:
---------
/stats: view your death count, kill count, and balance.
	Aliases: stat

Permissions:
------------
stats.view: gives permission to use the /stats command
(Alternatively, you can use stats.*, which gives you all the permissions, but seeing as there is only the one permission, I don't really see the point)

Dependencies:
=============
These plugins MUST be installed and enabled on your server for the plugin to be able to run! If they are not, the plugin will automatically disable itself.

Vault: Available at www.plugins.bukkit.com. Source code available at www.github.com/MilkBowl/Vault/.
Also required is an economy plugin of your choice. Most of them should be compatible with Vault.
